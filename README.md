# spotify_game
A mobile/web app with games using Spotify.

## Possibilities
The future possibilities include, but are not limited to:

## TODO-list
 - [ ] Come up with a name for the app and the individual games
 - [ ] Do some research on existing games
 - [ ] Determine front end framework
 - [ ] Determine back end framework
 - [ ] Document architecture of the software
    - [ ] Find suitable hosting service
 - [ ] Check if the possibilities are actually possible with the current Spotify API
  - [ ] Find suitable license

## MVP, minimum viable product
 - [ ] 1 of the games fully functions
    - [ ] A single play game is enough
